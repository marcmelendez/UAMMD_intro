# Example programs

## Introduction

* `helloWorld.cpp`: The iconic "Hello, World!" example written in C++.
* `rubberBall.cpp`: Simulation of a bouncing rubber ball.

## Our first UAMMD simulation

* `minimal.cu`: A minimal UAMMD program that only prints a Hello message and
  then exits.
* `freeExpansion.cu`: Ideal gas expanding freely in the vertical direction with
  periodic boundary conditions in the other two directions.
* `Lennard-Jones.cu`: Particles in a periodic box interacting through a
  Lennard-Jones potential.
* `superLennard-Jones.cu`: Improved Lennard-Jones system with logging and
  external parameter file.

## Unleash your own potential

* `vibratingString.cu`: A chain of particles linked by harmonic springs and held
   tight at the ends behaving like a vibrating string.
* `swingingRope.cu`: A chain of particles simulating a rope hanging from one of
   its ends, swinging back and forth in a gravitational field.
* `cable.cu`: A chain of particles simulating a flexible cable bending under its
   own weight.
* `curlyWire.cu`: A chain of particles behaving like a curly wire bending due to
   angular and torsional forces.
