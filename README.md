# A Painless Introduction to Programming UAMMD Modules

UAMMD stands for **Universally Adaptable Multiscale Molecular Dynamics**. You
can find the project at:

As the title of this book states, I aim to provide you with a painless 
introduction to writing UAMMD modules. I am writing with our research group's 
students in mind, imagining that you have begun to learn about molecular
simulation and have some (but not much) background in physics and programming.
If you need a more advanced approach, refer to the Wiki pages on the UAMMD
repository. Even if you don't, but you feel a painfully slow progress reading
this book, please skim through the pages and skip ahead until you find an
interesting section.
