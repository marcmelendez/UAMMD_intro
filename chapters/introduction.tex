\section*{On UAMMD}

The \textbf{Universally Adaptable Multiscale Molecular Dynamics} 
(\textbf{UAMMD}) project collects molecular simulation algorithms for Graphics 
Processing Units (GPUs) into header-only code. In layman's terms, this means 
that you can write programs in CUDA and include high-performance algorithms to 
carry out rigorous classical dynamics many-body simulations. UAMMD relies on the 
GPU's capacity to perform huge amounts of analogous computations in parallel to 
increase the speed at which it works out many-body interactions.
