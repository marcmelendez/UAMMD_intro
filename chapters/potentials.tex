You can only have so much fun playing with a Lennard-Jones simulation. Changing
the parameter values and then looking for differences in your plots gets old
soon. If you've made it this far, you want more. You imagine molecules, or
larger structures. Perhaps you'd like to simulate billowing smoke, sloshing
water, or planets orbiting a star. All in good time.

Whatever your final aim, you need new interactions, and this chapter contains a
good collection of them.

\section{Harmonic bonds}

The simplest permanent link between particles in UAMMD has to be the harmonic
bond. Think of it as an invisible linear spring connecting two particles. As
long as they remain at the equilibrium distance $r_0$, they exert no force on
each other, but when you stretch their separation $r$, they pull back. The
potential function for this bond, then, equals
\begin{equation*}
  V(r) = \frac{1}{2}\ K\ (r - r_0)^2,
\end{equation*}
where the spring constant $K$ quantifies the bond rigidity.

Take a string of one hundred and one particles as our explanatory device. We
will line them all up along a curved queue, standing initially at rest.
\label{stringInitialConditions}
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: stringInitialConditions
  int numberOfParticles = 101;
  auto particles
    = make_shared<ParticleData>(numberOfParticles, sys);

  {
    auto position
      = particles->getPos(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);
    auto velocity
      = particles->getVel(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);

    real amplitude = 0.1;
    real stringLength = 1.0;
    int modenum = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles; ++i) {
      position[i].x = i*(stringLength/(numberOfParticles - 1));
      position[i].y = amplitude*sin(modenum*M_PI*position[i].x);
      position[i].z = position[i].w = 0;
      velocity[i].x = velocity[i].y = velocity[i].z = 0;
    }
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

UAMMD reads bond information in from an external file. Let me first explain the
format of this plain text bond file. It should look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
100
0 1 1000.0 0.01
1 2 1000.0 0.01
2 3 1000.0 0.01
3 4 1000.0 0.01
    . . .
\end{lstlisting}
and so on. The file begins with the number of bonds ($100$) followed by a row
for each bond presenting $i$, $j$, $K$ and $r_0$, that is, the particle ID
numbers, the bond spring constant and the equilibrium distance. Hence, the next
line links particles $0$ and $1$ with a bond of $K = 1000.0$ and $r_0 = 0.01$.
After that, we get the values for the bond connecting particles $1$ and $2$.
Even though I have chosen identical values of $K$ and $r_0$ for all the bonds in
this example, you can of course make them all different if you like.

In addition to linking particles, you can attach them to fixed points in space.
We will pin particle $0$ to the origin of coordinates and particle $100$ to
point $(1, 0, 0)$. After the previous list of bonds, we must include the number
of fixed bonds (only $2$ in our case). The format for these is simply $i$, $x$,
$y$, $z$, $K$, $r_0$, meaning: particle ID, position in space $(x, y, z)$,
spring constant and equilibrium distance. So in our example, the bond file
should end with:
\begin{lstlisting}
2
0 0 0 0 1000.0 0.0
100 1 0 0 1000.0 0.0
%!
\end{lstlisting}
With the ends held in place, we have a taut string. As soon as we let go and run
the simulation, it should vibrate.

We will make the program write the bond information so that we don't have to.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: stringBondFile
  {
    std::ofstream bondInfo("data.bonds");
    if(not bondInfo.is_open()) {
      sys->log<System::CRITICAL>("Unable to create data.bonds file. Halting program.");
      exit(-1);
    }

    bondInfo<<(numberOfParticles - 1)<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles - 1; ++i) {
      bondInfo<<i<<" "<<(i + 1)<<" 1000.0 0.01"<<endl;
    }
    bondInfo<<"2"<<endl;
    bondInfo<<"0 0 0 0 1000.0 0.0"<<endl;
    bondInfo<<"100 1 0 0 1000.0 0.0"<<endl;
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

Including the bonds presents no difficulties from the point of view of UAMMD
code, as the code resembles the lines we wrote for the Lennard-Jones
interaction. You insert the customary include at the top,
\begin{lstlisting}
# include "Interactor/BondedForces.cuh"
%!
\end{lstlisting}
define the interaction parameters to create the ``interactor'',
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: stringBondInteractor
  {
    using HarmonicBonds = BondedForces<BondedType::Harmonic>;
    HarmonicBonds::Parameters bondParameters;
    bondParameters.file = "data.bonds";
    auto bonds = make_shared<HarmonicBonds>(particles, sys, bondParameters);
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
and then add the new bond interaction to the integrator.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: stringAddInteractor
    integrator->addInteractor(bonds);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

To replicate the simulation results shown in Figure \ref{vibratingString},
set the integrator parameters to these values:
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: VerletParameters
  using Verlet = VerletNVE;
  Verlet::Parameters VerletParams;
  VerletParams.dt = 0.001;
  VerletParams.initVelocities=false;
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
For the figure, I simulated twenty thousand steps and output the positions every
two thousand. Because I did not need a simulation box in this case, I eliminated
the corresponding block of code and changed the output command.
\begin{lstlisting}
      out<<endl;
      for(int id = 0; id < numberOfParticles; ++id)
        out<<position[index[id]]<<endl;
%!
\end{lstlisting}

  \caption{\label{vibratingString}A chain of $101$ particles connected with

           normal modes of vibration were achieved by setting the
           \texttt{modenum} variable (see page
           \pageref{stringInitialConditions}) to $n = 1, 2, 3,$ and $4$.}
\end{figure}

\section{External fields}

Figure \ref{vibratingString} may hold the attention of harmonic analysis
enthusiasts but, personally, I cannot wait to free the chain of particles at one
end and simulate a swinging rope. We already know how to deal with the bonds.
Just eliminate the final fixed bond in the data.bonds file, leaving the end of
the file like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
1
0 0 0 0 1000.0 0.0
%!
\end{lstlisting}

We are holding our chain only from the side at the origin of coordinates, but if
we expect to watch it swing back and forth, we cannot forget to implement the
force driving this motion: gravity.

Surely, we can add gravity into the mix with ease, right? It cannot be worse
than the Lennard-Jones potential or harmonic bonds. Well \ldots in a sense, it
does not differ much. You can incorporate it just as you would any other
interaction. Unfortunately, UAMMD was not designed with a standard gravity
interaction in mind, so we will have to write our own. Not to worry, though. We
will find it instructive and not too difficult.

In our model, gravity will appear as an external force field, meaning that it
does not act as an interaction among particles, but rather a force field that
affects each of them independently of the motions of the other particles. Thus,
\begin{lstlisting}
# include "Interactor/ExternalForces.cuh"
%!
\end{lstlisting}

An external force definition consists of four parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A setup.
  \item A rule for how to calculate the force on a particle.
  \item A rule for the particle energy due to the external field.
  \item A function that obtains the information needed to calculate the force
        and energy.
\end{enumerate}
In terms of code, we create a data structure with a real value $g$ for the
accleration of gravity.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityDefinition
struct gravitationalForce{
  real g;
%! codeinsert: gravityConstructor
%! codeinsert: gravityForce
%! codeinsert: gravityEnergy
%! codeinsert: gravityParticleInfo
};
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Now, between the declaration of $g$ and the closing bracket, we will insert the
four items listed above, beginning with a function that initialises the force.
It should only do one thing, take the numerical value given to $g$ and assign it
to the variable \texttt{g}. We can code it as an empty function.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityConstructor
  gravitationalForce(real numericalValueOfg):g(numericalValueOfg){}
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
The second item (the force) equals the mass of the particle times $-g$ in the
$y$ direction.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityForce
  __device__ __forceinline__ real3 force(const real4 &position, const real &mass){
    return make_real3(0.0f, -mass*g, 0.0f);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Next, we write the function for the gravitational potential energy.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityEnergy
  __device__ __forceinline__ real energy(const real4 &position, const real &mass){
    return mass*g*position.y;
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
We end the data structure telling the interaction where to get the position and
mass information.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityParticleInfo
  std::tuple<const real4 *, const real *> getArrays(ParticleData *particles){
    auto position = particles->getPos(access::location::gpu, access::mode::read);
    auto mass = particles->getMass(access::location::gpu, access::mode::read);
    return std::make_tuple(position.raw(), mass.raw());
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
You might have asked yourself why we handed the position over to the force
function even though it doesn't need to know the particle's location. The reason,
you might have guessed, lies in the tuple function, which extracts information
from the \texttt{particles} information and sends the same arguments to both the
force and energy functions.

Imagine we pull the rope out to the right. In addition to the positions and
velocities, we must also define the mass of each element in the rope.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: ropeInitialConditions
  {
    auto position
      = particles->getPos(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);
    auto velocity
      = particles->getVel(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);
    auto mass
      = particles->getMass(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);

    real ropeLength = real(1.0);
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles; ++i) {
      position[i].x = i*(ropeLength/(numberOfParticles - 1));
      position[i].y = position[i].z = position[i].w = real(0.0);
      velocity[i].x = velocity[i].y = velocity[i].z = real(0.0);
      mass[i] = real(0.001);
    }
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
It does not matter much whether you write the numerical values as \texttt{1.0}
or \texttt{real(1.0)} here. I recommend you get used to the second option in
UAMMD. It will help the compiler speed up your code by casting the floating
point number to the right precision.

To create the gravitational interaction and add it to the integrator, follow the
standard procedure.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: gravityInteraction
  {
    auto gravity
      = make_shared<ExternalForces<gravitationalForce>>(particles, sys, make_shared<gravitationalForce>(real(9.8)));

    integrator->addInteractor(gravity);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

Time for an important warning. If you want your code to compile with the changes
in this section, you must appease the spirits of \texttt{nvcc} with the flag
\texttt{--expt-relaxed-constexpr}.
\begin{lstlisting}
nvcc -I../uammd/src -I../uammd/src/third_party --expt-relaxed-constexpr -o swingingRope swingingRope.cu
\end{lstlisting}
as well as any other relevant options on your system. When all the pieces fit
together nicely, you should be able to reproduce Figure \ref{swingingRope}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.6 \textwidth]{figures/swingingRope.eps}
  \caption{\label{swingingRope}A chain of $101$ particles connected with

\section{Other types of bonds}

Harmonic bonds thread points together easily, but some circumstances require
other specialised types of bonds. Take a polymer strand in solution and zoom in
on a section of a few hundred monomers. It may behave like a harmonic spring
when you try to stretch it, but it will not extend indefinitely without
breaking. Harmonic potentials, in contrast, allow you to stretch a bond
indefinitely as long as you pull hard enough.

In settings like polymer research you would prefer a finitely extensible
nonlinear  elastic (FENE) bond. FENE bonds have a potential function given by
\begin{equation*}
  V_\text{FENE}(r) = -\frac{1}{2} K r_0^2\ 
                \ln\left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^2\right).
\end{equation*}
Note that the minimum value for $V_\text{FENE}(r)$ (with $r \geq 0$) lies at $r
= 0$, so the force will tend to pull the particles on top of each other.
Customarily, researchers combine FENE bonds with the repulsive part of
Lennard-Jones potentials, making the interaction potential between two bonded
particles equal to
\begin{equation*}
  V(r) =
    \begin{cases}
         V_\text{FENE}
         + \epsilon
         + 4\epsilon\left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}
                        - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right),
         & \text{ for } r \leq \sqrt[6]{2} \sigma, \\
         V_\text{FENE}
         & \text{ for } r > \sqrt[6]{2} \sigma.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, note that $V(r)$ diverges as $r$ approaches $r_0$. This guarantees
that particles will never separate further than $r_0$ as long as you choose
small enough integration time steps.

Within UAMMD, code for FENE bonds parallels that of harmonic bonds, but with a
different type, so you would define them with
\begin{lstlisting}
    using FENEBonds = BondedForces<BondedType::FENE>;
%!
\end{lstlisting}
When experimenting with FENE bonds, remember that linked particles must start
off with a separation smaller than $r_0$.

A different special case arises when modelling periodic structures. Picture an
infinite chain of particles stretching across the simulation box from left to
right. This we can simulate with periodic boundary conditions, but note that we
have to connect the leftmost particle not to the last particle on the right, but
rather to its periodic image to the left. Similarly, the particle closest to the
right of the box attaches to a periodic image of the first particle on the left.
Clearly, a bond crossing the whole width of the box will not do. We must specify
that a bond between particles $i$ and $j$ means between $i$ and the closest
periodic image of $j$ and viceversa. These types of bonds were named HarmonicPBC
and FENEPBC in UAMMD.

This chapter explains how to define your own bond types later on, after the
following section on angular potentials.

\section{Angular potentials}

How do you transform a rope into a flexible rod in UAMMD? Probably the easiest
route simply adds more bonds. Instead of connecting particles in a line only to
their nearest neighbours, connect them also to particles lying farther. This
approach is known as building an elastic network, and has many practical
applications.

Now imagine a molecule formed by atoms labelled $i$, $j$ and $k$, as in Figure
\ref{angularPotential}. Bonds connect particles $i$ and $j$, and particles $j$
and $k$. We could get the molecule to form the right angle $\theta$ by adding in
an extra bond between $i$ and $k$. If we wish to study the vibrations of our
molecule, we wouldn't usually employ that approach, though. Here's why. Forces
should tend to restore $\theta$ when the molecule undergoes a deformation that
changes this angle, but we can stretch the bond between $i$ and $k$ without
altering the angle $\theta$ by stretching the other two bonds in the the same
proportion. That would cause a force between $i$ and $k$ that should not be
there. Contrariwise, you can devise configurations with angles different from
$\theta$ while keeping the bond between $i$ and $k$ at the equilibrium length,
achieving a configuration where there is no force between $i$ and $k$ even
though there should be one. As a result, you get a molecule that doesn't wobble
as it should.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.5 \textwidth]{figures/angularSprings.eps}
  \caption{\label{angularPotential}Angular potentials cause forces on a triplet
           of particles when the angle $\theta$ they form differs from some 
           established equilibrium angle.}
\end{figure}

We can set up \textit{angular} potentials indicating the labels of the three 
particles involved, $i$, $j$ and $k$, the rigidity $K$ and the equilibrium angle 
$\theta_0$. When the particles form an angle $\theta \neq \theta_0$, they feel a 
force that tends to restore $\theta$ back to $\theta_0$. The angular potentials 
file would start with the number of triplets on the first line, followed by rows 
in which you specify $i$, $j$, $k$, $K$ and $\theta_0$, in that order. So a file 
with two angular potentials could look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
2
0 1 2 100 0
5 6 7 100 1.5708
%!
\end{lstlisting}
The first three particles would tend to lie on a straight line, while particles 
$5$, $6$ and $7$ would form a right angle. Note that $\theta_0$ refers to the 
equilibrium angle between $\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{jk}$ (see Fig. 
\ref{angularPotential}).

With the sole intention of showing you how angular potentials work, we'll 
transform our rope in the previous code into something like a fiberglass cable, 
in that it opposes bending slightly.

For starters, we hold the inital tenth of the cable horizontally with
fixed-point bonds, and let gravity bend the rest of the cable.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: cableFixedBonds
    bondInfo<<"10"<<endl;

    real cableLength = real(1.0);
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      bondInfo<<i<<" "<<i*(cableLength/(numberOfParticles - 1))<<" 0 0 1000.0 0.0"<<endl;
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
We will need a smaller time step to resolve the motion.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: cableTimeStep
  VerletParams.dt = real(0.00001);
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Consequently, we increase the number of steps to integrate.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: cableNumberOfSteps
  int numberOfSteps = 150000;
  int printEverynSteps = 5000;
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

Now let us link our chain with angular potentials, by attaching every three
consecutive particles with $K = 2.0$ and $\theta_0 = 0$.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: angularForcesFile
  {
    std::ofstream angularInfo("data.angularForces");
    if(not angularInfo.is_open()) {
      sys->log<System::CRITICAL>("Unable to create data.angularForces file. Halting program.");
      exit(-1);
    }

    real K = 2.0, theta0 = 0.0;
    angularInfo<<(numberOfParticles - 2)<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles - 2; ++i) {
      angularInfo<<i<<" "<<(i + 1)<<" "<<(i + 2)<<" "<<K<<" "<<theta0<<endl;
    }
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

If we connect our UAMMD module to the relevant header,
\begin{lstlisting}
# include "Interactor/AngularBondedForces.cuh"
%!
\end{lstlisting}
creating the interaction follows the usual rules, but notice that you need to
have a simulation box defined (as explained in section \ref{simulation_box}). We
will just make the box infinite in every direction.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: cableBox
  real L = std::numeric_limits<real>::infinity();
  Box box(make_real3(L, L, L));
%! codeblockend

To generate the angular forces interaction, we write code that parallels the
creation of harmonic bonds.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: angularForces
  {
    using angularPotentials
      = AngularBondedForces<AngularBondedForces_ns::AngularBond>;
    angularPotentials::Parameters angularParameters;
    angularParameters.readFile = "data.angularForces";
    auto angularForces
      = make_shared<angularPotentials>(particles, sys,
                                       angularParameters,
                                       std::make_shared<AngularBondedForces_ns::AngularBond>(box));
    integrator->addInteractor(angularForces);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
I should briefly comment on three annoying peculiarities in the code snippet
above. One, the bond type has an irritatingly redundant long name:
\begin{verbatim}
AngularBondedForces_ns::AngularBond
\end{verbatim}
Two, the file name parameter in this case was set to ``\texttt{readFile}'', 
instead of ``\texttt{file}'' as it was called for harmonic bonds. Three, for 
obscure design reasons that we do not care about now, the interactor takes a 
shared pointer to the bond type as an extra parameter.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width = 0.6 \textwidth]{figures/cable.eps}
  \caption{\label{cable}101 particles simulating a flexible cable bending under 
           its own weight. The tenth of the cable closest to the origin was held
           in place with fixed-point bonds.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{cable} shows the result of running the cable program. When compared
to Figure \ref{swingingRope}, you can clearly see we have increased our chain's
aversion to bending.

We're not yet done with angular potentials, though. Look at the molecule in 
Figure \ref{torsionalSprings}. There, we could set up angular forces that
restored the angle between $\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{jk}$, and between
$\mathbf{r}_{jk}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{kl}$. However, $\mathbf{r}_{kl}$ would still 
swivel freely around the axis going through $\mathbf{r}_{jk}$, unless we define
some potential that opposes the torsion of this molecule. This we can achieve
with the torsional forces interaction.
\begin{lstlisting}
# include "Interactor/TorsionalBondedForces.cuh"
%!
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.6 \textwidth]{figures/torsionalSprings.eps}
  \caption{\label{torsionalSprings}Torsional potentials oppose torsion. In the
           diagram above, a torsional potential would act to restore the
           equilibrium value of $\phi$, the angle formed between the plane
           shared by particles $i$, $j$ and $k$, and the plane shared by $j$,
           $k$ and $l$.}
\end{figure}

It will not surprise you to learn that the file format for torsional forces
begins with the number of quartets followed by rows of $i$, $j$, $k$, $l$, $K$
and $\phi_0$ for each relevant torsion angle.

With a few changes to our cable code we'll simulate a curly wire. To simplify
our code slightly, we leave out gravity and fixed-point bonds. In consequence,
we must provide some curvature. Otherwise, the chain will remain stretched out
in a state of unstable equilibrium. We will add in a slight torsion as well, to
bias the torsional forces.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: wireInitialConditions
  {
    auto position
      = particles->getPos(access::location::cpu,
                          access::mode::write);

      = particles->getVel(access::location::cpu,

    real wireLength = 1.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles; ++i) {
      position[i].x
        = wireLength/(2*M_PI)*cos(2*M_PI*i/(numberOfParticles - 1));
      position[i].y
        = wireLength/(2*M_PI)*sin(2*M_PI*i/(numberOfParticles - 1));
      position[i].z = 0.0001*i;
      position[i].w = 0;
      velocity[i].x = velocity[i].y = velocity[i].z = 0;
    }
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Soften the angular forces and set the curvature of the chain with
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: wireCurvature
    real K = 1.0, theta0 = 4*M_PI/(numberOfParticles - 1);
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Now for the torsional potentials connecting every four sequential points.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: torsionalForcesFile

    if(not torsionalInfo.is_open()) {
      sys->log<System::CRITICAL>("Unable to create data.torsionalForces file. Halting program.");
      exit(-1);
    }

    real K = 0.1, phi0 = 0.01;
    torsionalInfo<<(numberOfParticles - 3)<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles - 2; ++i) {

Torsion interactors replicate the structure of the angular interaction code
written above.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: torsionalForces
  {
    using torsionalPotentials
     = TorsionalBondedForces<TorsionalBondedForces_ns::TorsionalBond>;
    torsionalPotentials::Parameters torsionalParameters;
    torsionalParameters.readFile = "data.torsionalForces";
    auto torsionalForces
     = make_shared<torsionalPotentials>(particles, sys,
                                        torsionalParameters,
                                        std::make_shared<TorsionalBondedForces_ns::TorsionalBond>(box));
    integrator->addInteractor(torsionalForces);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
This time, I carried out a longer time integration.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: wireNumberOfSteps

  int printEverynSteps = 10000;

           state of the wire, while the grey line presents the final state when
           you deactivate the torsional potentials.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{curlyWire} compares the initial and final state of the wire after
running the simulation. Not only does the wire curl up, it also moves in the
direction perpendicular to the $xy$ plane. Deactivating the torsional forces
leads to a completely different outcome, of course.

\section{Custom bonds}

At least in theory, neither harmonic nor FENE bonds break, no matter how hard
you pull on them. In contrast, the Morse potential, used to model diatomic
molecules and some polymer chains, does allow linked particles to break free.
UAMMD has no default Morse bond potential, so let me implement it for you, and 
you'll see how to create your own bonds.

Like Harmonic bonds, the Morse potential depends on the distance $r$ between 
bonded particles, but three parameters determine its shape, instead of two.
\begin{equation*}
  V(r) = D_e\left(\left(e^{-a(r - r_0)} - 1\right)^2 - 1\right).
\end{equation*}
$D_e$ marks the depth of the potential, $a$ determines its width, and $r_0$ the
equilibrium distance. As we did with gravity, we create a new data structure
before \texttt{main}, opening with
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorsePotential
struct Morse {
%! codeinsert: MorseParameters
%! codeinsert: MorseReadBonds
%! codeinsert: MorseEnergy
%! codeinsert: MorseForce
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
The data structure must contain four items:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A list of the parameter variables that define the bond, packed into a
        data structure.
  \item A function detailing how to read the bond parameter values from a file.
  \item A function for the energy as a function of the inter-particle 
        separation.
  \item The force due to the interaction.
\end{enumerate}
The item at the top of the list would come out as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseParameters
  struct BondInfo {
    real De, a, r0;
  };
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
In the file listing the bonds, we would like to begin with the number of bonds,
followed by rows of $i$, $j$, $D_e$, $a$, and $r0$, by analogy with previous
bond data. UAMMD assumes this layout, but does not know how many parameters you
will need to read for your particular type of bond, nor the right order. This we
specify in a \texttt{readBond} function.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseReadBonds
  static __host__ BondInfo readBond(std::istream &in) {
    BondInfo MorseParams;
    in>>MorseParams.De>>MorseParams.a>>MorseParams.r0;
    return MorseParams;
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
The energy function calculates $V(r)$, according to the aforementioned Morse
potential.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseEnergy
  inline __device__ real energy(int i, int j,
                                 const real3 &rij,
                                 const BondInfo &MorseParams) {
    real r = sqrtf(dot(rij, rij));
    real oneminusexpar
      = real(1.0) - exp(-MorseParams.a*(r - MorseParams.r0));
    return MorseParams.De*(oneminusexpar*oneminusexpar - real(1.0));
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, we close our \texttt{Morse} data structure with the force, which equals 
the negative gradient of the energy,
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})
    = -\nabla V(r)
    = 2 D_e a \left(e^{-a(r - r_0)} - 1\right)
              e^{-a(r - r0)}\ \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r}.
\end{equation*}
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseForce
  inline __device__ real3 force(int i, int j,
                                const real3 &rij,
                                const BondInfo &MorseParams) {
    real r = sqrtf(dot(rij, rij));
    real expar = exp(-MorseParams.a*(r - MorseParams.r0));
    return real(2.0)*MorseParams.De*MorseParams.a
                    *((expar - 1)*expar/r)*rij;
  }
};
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

To incorporate our new interaction, proceed as with the Harmonic bonds, but
replacing the \texttt{BondedType::Harmonic} with our \texttt{Morse}.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseInteraction
  {
    using MorseBonds = BondedForces<Morse>;
    MorseBonds::Parameters bondParameters;
    bondParameters.file = "data.bonds";
    auto bonds = make_shared<MorseBonds>(particles, sys,
                                         bondParameters);

    integrator->addInteractor(bonds);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

As a test, I swapped the bonds in the swinging rope simulation with our newer 
design. I had to remember to change the data written to the \texttt{data.bonds} 
file.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseBondFile
    real De = 0.025, a = 200.0, r0 = 0.01;
    bondInfo<<(numberOfParticles - 1)<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfParticles - 1; ++i) {
      bondInfo<<i<<" "<<(i + 1)<<" "
              <<De<<" "<<a<<" "<<r0<<endl;
    }
    bondInfo<<"1"<<endl;
    bondInfo<<"0 0 0 0 "<<De<<" "<<a<<" "<<r0<<endl;
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Written in this way, the simulation would still not work because of particle 
$0$, which begins at the origin, making $r = 0$ for the fixed-point bond. This
made the code divide by zero, outputting a \texttt{nan} (\textit{not a number})
that caused an avalanche of \texttt{nan}s in the computations. To avoid the
problem, I began with the whole chain shifted slightly to the right.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorseChainInitialConditions
      position[i].x = (1 + i)*(ropeLength/(numberOfParticles - 1));
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.6 \textwidth]{figures/MorseChain.eps}
  \caption{\label{MorseChain} A chain of particles linked and attached to the 
           origin with Morse potentials swings under its own weight and ends up 
           breaking off and falling (\textit{time step}: $10^{-5}$, 
           $1.5 \times 10^5$ steps, printing out every $5 \times 10^3$).}
\end{figure}

When the simulation runs, the fixed-point bond snaps as the chain of particles
swings around (Figure \ref{MorseChain}).

\section{Custom pair potentials}

Our definition of Morse bond potentials describes the phenomenon of
dissociation, but we wouldn't use it to produce bond formation. Particles $i$
and $j$ would only link if the connection had been listed already in the
\texttt{data.bonds} file. To allow bonds to form between any two candidate
particles, we would be much better off coding the Morse potential as a pair
interaction.

Starting from our Lennard-Jones code written in the previous chapter, let us 
replace the pair potential with a Morse interaction. We will again capture the
interaction within a data structure, beginning with the parameters and a 
constructor to assign their values. Before the main function, we write the 
following.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: MorsePairPotential
struct Morse {
  real De, a, r0, rc;

  Morse(real i_De, real i_a, real i_r0, real i_rc):
       De(i_De), a(i_a), r0(i_r0), rc(i_rc){}
  %! codeinsert: getCutOff
  %! codeinsert: ForceEnergy
  %! codeinsert: getTransverser
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
Pair potentials must include a function called \texttt{getCutOff} that returns
the range of the potential interaction.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: getCutOff
  real getCutOff() { return rc; }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we come to our first definition of a \textit{transverser}, a key concept 
in the UAMMD infrastructure, likely named after the action of traversing a list 
(the word \textit{traverser} apparently didn't sound cool enough, though). 
You'll understand the idea easily. For each particle, we wish to apply a 
function to each particle-neighbour pair. In this case, we wish to compute the 
force and energy due to the interactions of a particle with each of its 
neighbours.

We'll define our transverser as a data structure that begins setting the values
of the parameters.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: ForceEnergy
  struct ForceEnergy {
    real4 * force;
    real * energy;
    Box box;
    real De, a, r0, rc;

    ForceEnergy(Box i_box, real i_rc,
                real4 * i_force, real * i_energy,
                real i_De, real i_a, real i_r0):
                box(i_box), rc(i_rc),
                force(i_force), energy(i_energy),
                De(i_De), a(i_a), r0(i_r0){}
    %! codeinsert: compute_and_set
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
It ends with two functions, one computes the force and energy for each pair 
interaction, according to the Morse potential, and the other specifies what to 
do with the results.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: compute_and_set
    __device__ real4 compute(real4 ri, real4 rj){
      const real3 rij = box.apply_pbc(make_real3(rj)-make_real3(ri));
      const real r2 = dot(rij, rij);
      const real r = sqrtf(r2);
      if(r2 > 0 and r < rc){
        const real expar = exp(-a*(r - r0));
        const real oneminusexpar = real(1.0) - expar;
        return make_real4(-2.0*De*a*((expar - 1)*expar/r)*rij,
                          De*(oneminusexpar*oneminusexpar - real(1.0)));
      }
      return real4();
    }

    __device__ void set(int id, real4 total){
      force[id] += make_real4(total.x, total.y, total.z, 0);
      energy[id] += total.w;
    }
  };
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}
There are additional functions designed to tweak the behaviour of your 
transversers, but we won't need them for the time being.

Finally, the containing \texttt{Morse} structure ends with a function that 
returns the \texttt{ForceEnergy} transverser just defined, setting the values of 
the parameters and the references to the force and energy lists.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: getTransverser
  ForceEnergy getForceTransverser(Box box, std::shared_ptr<ParticleData> sys){
    auto force = sys->getForce(access::location::gpu,
                               access::mode::readwrite).raw();
    auto energy = sys->getEnergy(access::location::gpu,
                                 access::mode::readwrite).raw();
    return ForceEnergy(box, rc, force, energy, De, a, r0);
  }
};
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

That defined a new pair potential. You can probably imagine what comes next.
Adding the new interaction to the Verlet integrator follows the usual rules.
\begin{lstlisting}
%! codeblock: addMorsePairPotential
  real De = real(1.0);
  real a = real(2.0);
  real r0 = real(1.0);
  real rc = real(6.5)*r0;

  auto MorsePotential = make_shared<Morse>(De, a, r0, rc);
  {
    using MorseForces = PairForces<Morse>;
    MorseForces::Parameters interactionParams;
    interactionParams.box = box;

    auto interaction
      = make_shared<MorseForces>(particles, sys,
                              interactionParams,
                              MorsePotential);

    integrator->addInteractor(interaction);
  }
%! codeblockend
\end{lstlisting}

The Morse interaction module replicates the Lennard-Jones code from chapter one,
replacing the interaction with the Morse potential defined in this section.

\section{The curve-hopping problem}

\begin{comment}
List of programs written in this chapter:
%! codeblock: codelist
* `vibratingString.cu`: A chain of particles linked by harmonic springs and held
   tight at the ends behaving like a vibrating string.
* `swingingRope.cu`: A chain of particles simulating a rope hanging from one of
   its ends, swinging back and forth in a gravitational field.
* `cable.cu`: A chain of particles simulating a flexible cable bending under its
   own weight.
* `curlyWire.cu`: A chain of particles behaving like a curly wire bending due to
   angular and torsional forces.
* `MorseChain.cu`: A chain of particles connected with Morse bond potentials and
   attached to the origin in a uniform gravitational field.
* `Morse.cu`: Particles in a periodic box interacting through a Morse potential.
